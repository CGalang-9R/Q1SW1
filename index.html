	<h1>Musical Theatre and I</h1>
	<hr/>
	<p><strong>Musical theatre</strong> is a theatrical performance that has <em>singing, spoken dialogue, acting, and dancing.</em><br/> This entertaining spectacle of a show has been a <mark>significant part of my life</mark> ever since I watched my first live musical, Annie. I remember being so amazed by the entire production and the way they were able to make a story come to life on stage. Since then, <mark>musical theatre had a special place in my heart.</mark></p>

	<h2>Why I love it so much</h2>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li><strong><pre>The Performance:</pre></strong>The way the actors put everything into their <mark>singing, acting, and dancing</mark> is simply <em>phenomenal.</em> Not only that, but they are also able to <mark>translate the meaningful message </mark>of the show to the audience which is impressive. These actors are truly hard workers.</li>
		<li><strong><pre>The Set:</pre></strong> We obviously cannot forget the <mark/>amazing sets</mark> made by the company. These are often <em>so creative and beautifully made</em> and also play a <em>vital role</em> in the performance. They put in the <mark>location and tone</mark> of the show to be able to have a more authentic experience for the actors and the audience.</li>
		<li><strong><pre>The Costumes:</pre></strong> Costumes can go from <em>so intricate to very simple</em> and they would still be able to impact the show the same way as long as they made sense. They help the actors <mark>get into character</mark> and lets them <mark>step into the character’s shoes.</mark> I absolutely love being able to analyze the different costumes because they are a great <mark>representation of the character's personality.</mark></li>
		<li><strong><pre>The Experience:</pre></strong> Watching from a screen is incredibly different from watching it live. I <em>adore and enjoy the experience</em> and I <em>get chills every time</em> because of everything that is happening live. The <mark>set is usually right in front of you, the music can be heard from all around, and almost everything is physically present and performing.</mark></li>
